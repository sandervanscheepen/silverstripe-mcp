# 6.0.0 {#600}

Silverstripe CMS 6.0.0 is a major release. That means it contains many breaking changes and dependency upgrades. We tried our best to minimise upgrades woes, but you should allocate additional time to account for regression testing.

This changelog provides a list of changes between Silverstripe CMS 5.4 and 6.0.

## Overview {#overview}

A full list of module versions included in CMS Recipe 6.0.0 is provided below. We recommend referencing recipes in your dependencies, rather than individual modules, to simplify version tracking. See [Recipes](/en/6/getting_started/).

## Changes to commercially supported modules {#changes-to-support}

Some Silverstripe CMS modules are commercially supported. Silverstripe commits to looking after those modules for the duration of the Silverstripe CMS 6 lifecycle.

Review the list of [Commercially Supported Modules for Silverstripe CMS 6](/en/6/project_governance/supported_modules/).

### Modules losing commercial support {#modules-losing-support}

Some modules that were commercially supported in Silverstripe CMS 5 are not supported in Silverstripe CMS 6. Some of those modules provide CMS6-compatible versions. Others have been dropped altogether.

Just because a module is not "commercially supported", doesn't mean that you shouldn't be using it. Community supported modules are maintained on a "best-effort" basis. You should take this into consideration when choosing to install a community supported module in your project.

Email [community@silverstripe.org](/en/6/changelogs/mailto:community@silverstripe.org/) if you are keen to maintain some of the modules that are no longer commercially supported.

The code in `silverstripe/externallinks`, `silverstripe/security-report`, and `silverstripe/sitewidecontent-report` has been copied into `silverstripe/reports` and will be maintained there going forward. The namespaces for classes in those modules has been updated to `SilverStripe\Reports`. Note that any code that related to `silverstripe/subsites` or `silverstripe/contentreview` integration has been removed.

CMS 6 compatible versions of `silverstripe/blog`, `silverstripe/crontask`, `silverstripe/hybridsessions`, `silverstripe/subsites`, and `silverstripe/webauthn-authenticator` have been released with CMS 6.0.0, though they are not commercially supported.

### `silverstripe/campaign-admin` no longer part of `silverstripe/recipe-cms` {#campaign-admin}

The `silverstripe/campaign-admin` module is no longer included in `silverstripe/recipe-cms`. If your `composer.json` requires `silverstripe/recipe-cms` and you wish to continue using `silverstripe/campaign-admin`, then you will need to add manually add it to your project's `composer.json`.

### New supported modules {#new-supported-modules}

Some new modules have been created and are now covered by our [supported modules policy](/en/6/project_governance/supported_modules/). These modules will be supported for the full lifetime of Silverstripe CMS 6.

- [`silverstripe/htmleditor-tinymce`](https://packagist.org/packages/silverstripe/htmleditor-tinymce). See [TinyMCE is in a separate module now](#tinymce) for more details.

- [`silverstripe/startup-theme`](https://packagist.org/packages/silverstripe/startup-theme). See [new default front-end theme](#theme) below for more details.

- [`silverstripe/template-engine` module](https://packagist.org/packages/silverstripe/template-engine). See [abstraction of template rendering](#view-layer-abstraction) for more details.

### TinyMCE is in a separate module now {#tinymce}

WARNING
To continue using TinyMCE as an HTML editor in your existing project, you must add [`silverstripe/htmleditor-tinymce`](https://packagist.org/packages/silverstripe/htmleditor-tinymce) as an explicit dependency.

Silverstripe CMS 6 continues to use TinyMCE 6, the same version used in CMS 5. We chose not to upgrade to TinyMCE 7 because that version of TinyMCE has a `GPLv2+` license which is incompatible with our `BSD-3` license.

Instead, we have moved all TinyMCE functionality used by Silverstripe CMS into a new module - `silverstripe/htmleditor-tinymce`. To continue using TinyMCE in your project, you must add that dependency in your `composer.json` file.

We plan to replace TinyMCE with a new default HTML editor in a future minor release of Silverstripe CMS. Existing projects will be able to opt-in when it becomes available. Both new and existing projects can continue using TinyMCE for the lifetime of CMS 6.

To facilitate swapping to a new editor, we have further abstracted the [`HTMLEditorConfig`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CHTMLEditor%5CHTMLEditorConfig&version=6) class and related functionality. This change makes it easier to replace TinyMCE with a different HTML editor in the future.

Part of this change includes a new way to define rules such as which elements and attributes are allowed in HTML content. You can continue to set the `valid_elements` and `extended_valid_elements` configuration on a [`TinyMCEConfig`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CTinyMCE%5CTinyMCEConfig&version=6) object if you want to, but the new API is generic and will work for any `HTMLEditorConfig` implementation and can be defined in YAML configuration.

See [defining HTML editor configurations](/en/6/developer_guides/forms/field_types/htmleditorfield/#defining-html-editor-configurations) for details about the new generalised API, and [optional features > TinyMCE HTML editor](/en/6/optional_features/htmleditor-tinymce/) for any TinyMCE-specific documentation.

#### If you want TinyMCE 7 anyway {#if-you-want-tinymce-7-anyway}

If you want to use TinyMCE 7 in your own projects, and have done your due diligence to validate that its [new license](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/latest/license-key/) won't cause you any legal problems, you can theoretically do that.

Note that using TinyMCE 7 with Silverstripe CMS isn't supported and has not been tested. The plugins, skin, and configuration that come with `silverstripe/htmleditor-tinymce` are not guaranteed to work with TinyMCE 7.

Configure the [`TinyMCEConfig`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CTinyMCE%5CTinyMCEConfig&version=6) class to use your own copy of TinyMCE by setting the [`base_dir`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=api:SilverStripe%5CTinyMCE%5CTinyMCEConfig->base_dir&version=6) configuration property to the directory which holds your TinyMCE JavaScript distribution files. Then define the URL for the `silverstripe` skin if you want to use it:

phpgetResource('client/dist/tinymce/skins/ui/silverstripe')->getURL();
TinyMCEConfig::get('cms')->setOption('skin_url', $skinUrl);
" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard">📋 Copy```php
// app/_config.php
use SilverStripe\Core\Manifest\ModuleLoader;
use SilverStripe\TinyMCE\TinyMCEConfig;

$module = ModuleLoader::getModule('silverstripe/htmleditor-tinymce');
$skinUrl = $module->getResource('client/dist/tinymce/skins/ui/silverstripe')->getURL();
TinyMCEConfig::get('cms')->setOption('skin_url', $skinUrl);
```

### New default front-end theme {#theme}

New projects created using `silverstripe/installer` will notice a new theme [`silverstripe/startup-theme`](https://packagist.org/packages/silverstripe/startup-theme) which replaces `silverstripe-themes/simple`.

The new theme is visually very similar to the old one, but has been built from the ground up with cascading themes and customisability in mind. For example you can customise a lot of the styling by changing values of CSS variables.

The new theme also outputs the `$ElementalArea` by default if you have [`dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental`](https://packagist.org/packages/dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental) installed, and exposes the [`$SilverStripeNavigator`](/en/6/developer_guides/templates/common_variables/#silverstripenavigator) for logged in users.

Most projects will still benefit from a custom built theme, but this new theme should make it easier to test and validate PHP code changes in the early stages of a project and for module development.

## Dependency changes {#dependency-changes}

### PHP version support {#php-version-support}

Silverstripe CMS 6 requires either PHP 8.3 or PHP 8.4.

PHP 8.1 and PHP 8.2 (which were supported in Silverstripe CMS 5) are no longer supported.

### MySQL 5 no longer supported {#mysql-5-support}

MySQL 5.6 and 5.7 are no longer supported. The minimum supported version is MySQL 8.0. We support and test against the latest LTS releases of MySQL and MariaDB.

### Support for PHPUnit 11 {#phpunit}

PHPUnit 11 is now used for unit testing core and supported modules. We recommend upgrading to that version for your own projects and modules as well.

Part of this upgrade includes a change to assertions which expect warnings, errors, and notices. See [asserting errors, warnings and notices](/en/6/developer_guides/testing/unit_testing/#asserting-errors-warnings-and-notices) for details.

PHPUnit 11 accepts multiple file paths as arguments, where previously it ignored any arguments after the first one. This change means the old way to flush your cache during a unit test run (adding `flush=1` as an argument, e.g.`vendor/bin/phpunit &#x3C;filepath> flush=1`) doesn't work. Instead, we've added a new environment variable specifically for this purpose. To flush your cache during a unit test run using PHPUnit 11, set the `SS_PHPUNIT_FLUSH` environment variable (e.g. `SS_PHPUNIT_FLUSH=1 vendor/bin/phpunit &#x3C;filepath>`).

### `intervention/image`has been upgraded from v2 to v3 {#intervention-image}

We've upgraded from `intervention/image` v2 to v3. One of the main improvements included in this upgrade is improved support for animated images.

If you are directly interacting with APIs from `intervention/image` in your project or module you should check out [their upgrade guide](https://image.intervention.io/v3/getting-started/upgrade).

#### Animated vs still images {#intervention-image-animations}

Manipulating animated images takes longer, and results in a larger filesize.

Because of this, the [`ThumbnailGenerator`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssetAdmin%5CModel%5CThumbnailGenerator&version=6) will provide still images as thumbnails for animated gifs by default. You can change that for a given instance of `ThumbnailGenerator` by passing `true` to the [`setAllowsAnimation()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssetAdmin%5CModel%5CThumbnailGenerator::setAllowsAnimation()&version=6) method. For example, to allow animated thumbnails for `UploadField`:

yaml📋 Copy```yaml
---
After: '#assetadminthumbnails'
---
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\Model\ThumbnailGenerator.assetadmin:
    properties:
      AllowsAnimation: true
```

The [`Image::PreviewLink()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CImage::PreviewLink()&version=6) method also doesn't allow an animated result by default. This is used in the "Files" admin section, and anywhere you can choose an existing image such as `UploadField` and the WYSIWYG file modals.

You can allow animated previews by setting [`Image.allow_animated_preview`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CImage->allow_animated_preview&version=6) configuration property to `true`:

yaml📋 Copy```yaml
SilverStripe\Assets\Image:
  allow_animated_preview: true
```

You can disable the ability to create animated variants globally by setting `decodeAnimation` to `false` in the `Intervention\Image\ImageManager`'s constructor:

yaml📋 Copy```yaml
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  Intervention\Image\ImageManager:
    constructor:
      decodeAnimation: false
```

You can also toggle that configuration setting on and off for a given image instance, or create a variant from your image which uses a specific frame of animation - see [animated images](/en/6/developer_guides/files/images/#animated-images) for details.

#### Using GD or Imagick {#intervention-image-driver}

One of the changes that comes as a result of this upgrade is a change in how you configure which manipulation driver (GD or Imagick) to use.

To facilitate upgrades and to ensure we are providing optimal defaults out of the box, if you have the [imagick PHP extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.imagick.php) installed, it will be used as the driver for `intervention/image` by default. If you don't, the assumption is that you have the [GD PHP extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) installed, and it will be used instead.

See [changing the manipulation driver](/en/6/developer_guides/files/images/#intervention-image-driver) for the new configuration for swapping the driver used by `intervention/image`.

#### New API {#intervention-image-new-api}

The following new methods have been added to facilitate this upgrade:

| Method name | Where the method was added |
| --- | --- |
| `getIsAnimated()` | [`AssetContainer::getIsAnimated()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CStorage%5CAssetContainer::getIsAnimated()&version=6), [`ImageManipulation::getIsAnimated()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CImageManipulation::getIsAnimated()&version=6) (and therefore `DBFile`, `File`, and their subclasses), [`Image_Backend::getIsAnimated()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CImage_Backend::getIsAnimated()&version=6), [`InterventionBackend::getIsAnimated()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CInterventionBackend::getIsAnimated()&version=6) |
| `RemoveAnimation()` | [`ImageManipulation::RemoveAnimation()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CImageManipulation::RemoveAnimation()&version=6) (and therefore `DBFile`, `File`, and their subclasses), [`Image_Backend::removeAnimation()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CImage_Backend::removeAnimation()&version=6), [`InterventionBackend::removeAnimation()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CInterventionBackend::removeAnimation()&version=6) |
| `getAllowsAnimationInManipulations()` | [`Image_Backend::getAllowsAnimationInManipulations()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CImage_Backend::getAllowsAnimationInManipulations()&version=6), [`InterventionBackend::getAllowsAnimationInManipulations()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CInterventionBackend::getAllowsAnimationInManipulations()&version=6) |
| `setAllowsAnimationInManipulations()` | [`Image_Backend::setAllowsAnimationInManipulations()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CImage_Backend::setAllowsAnimationInManipulations()&version=6), [`InterventionBackend::setAllowsAnimationInManipulations()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CInterventionBackend::setAllowsAnimationInManipulations()&version=6) |
| `getAllowsAnimation()` | [`ThumbnailGenerator::getAllowsAnimation()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssetAdmin%5CModel%5CThumbnailGenerator::getAllowsAnimation()&version=6) |
| `setAllowsAnimation()` | [`ThumbnailGenerator::setAllowsAnimation()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssetAdmin%5CModel%5CThumbnailGenerator::setAllowsAnimation()&version=6) |

### Symfony dependencies have been upgraded from v6 to v7 {#symfony}

We've upgraded the various Symfony dependencies from v6 to v7, as per our [fixes dependencies policy](/en/6/project_governance/fixed_dependencies/).

### JavaScript dependencies {#javascript-dependencies}

Several JavaScript dependencies have been updated, and a few have been replaced.

Notably, [`react-dnd`](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about) has been replaced with [`dnd-kit`](https://dndkit.com/). If you were using `react-dnd` and relying on the webpack externals provided by `silverstripe/admin`, these are no longer available. We recommend refactoring your code to use `dnd-kit` so that your UX is consistent with other drag-and-drop in the CMS.

#### Webpack config {#webpack-config}

The [`@silverstripe/webpack-config`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@silverstripe/webpack-config) NPM library has been updated to reflect changes in which components are exposed from supported modules.

If you are using this library in your CMS customisations, make sure you bump the dependency in your `package.json` file to `^3`.

#### Bootstrap upgrade {#bootstrap-upgrade}

We have upgraded [`bootstrap`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap) from 4 to 5. Part of this upgrade also included upgrading [`reactstrap`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactstrap) from 8 to 9 and upgrading [`popperjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@popperjs/core) from 1 to 2.

Refer to the following upgrade guides for details about changes you may need to make to styling and JavaScript in your CMS customisations:

- [bootstrap upgrade guide](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/migration/)

- [reactstrap upgrade guide](https://reactstrap.github.io/?path=/story/home-upgrading--page)

- [popper upgrade guide](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/migration-guide/)

Note that while the bootstrap guide mentions removing the styling for the `.form-group`, `.form-row`, or `.form-inline` CSS classes, that styling has been retained in the CMS to reduce upgrade pain.

## Upgrade tools {#upgrade-tools}

There isn't a commercially supported upgrade tool to support this major release. However, the community have created two tools based on rector which use static analysis to automate some of the more tedious upgrade tasks, such as updating `use` statements for classes with new namespaces.

- [`cambis/silverstripe-rector`](https://github.com/Cambis/silverstripe-rector)

- [`wernerkrauss/silverstripe-rector`](https://github.com/wernerkrauss/silverstripe-rector)

## Features and enhancements {#features-and-enhancements}

### Validation added to `DBField`s {#dbfield-validation}

[`DBField`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBField&version=6) is the base class for all database fields in Silverstripe CMS. For instance when you define `'MyField' => 'Varchar(255)'` in your [`DataObject`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject&version=6) subclass, the `MyField` property will be backed by an instance of [`DBVarchar`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBVarchar&version=6).

Validation has been added to most `DBField` subclasses. This means that when a value is set on a `DBField` subclass, it can be validated against the constraints of that field. This field validation is called as part of [`DataObject::validate()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject::validate()&version=6) which itself is called as part of [`DataObject::write()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject::write()&version=6). If a value is invalid then a [`ValidationException`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CValidation%5CValidationException&version=6) will be thrown.

For example, if you have a `Varchar(64)`, and you try to set a value longer than 64 characters, an exception will now be thrown. Previously, the value would be truncated to 64 characters and saved to the database.

The validation is added through subclasses of the new [`FieldValidator`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CValidation%5CFieldValidation%5CFieldValidator&version=6) abstract class, for instance the [`StringFieldValidator`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CValidation%5CFieldValidation%5CStringFieldValidator&version=6) is used to validate [`DBVarchar`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBVarchar&version=6). See [data types and casting](/en/6/developer_guides/model/data_types_and_casting/#available-types) for a full list of validation rules.

Note that this new `DBField` validation is independent of the existing CMS form field validation that uses methods such as [`FormField::validate()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CFormField::validate()&version=6) and [`DataObject::getCMSCompositeValidator()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject::getCMSCompositeValidator()&version=6).

The `setValue()` methods of some `DBField` subclasses convert the value to the correct type before validating it, for example:

- [`DBBoolean`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBBoolean&version=6) uses the `tinyint` data type and retains the legacy behaviour of converting `true/'true'/'t'/'1'` to `1`, `false/'false'/'f'/'0'` to `0`.

- [`DBDecimal`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBDecimal&version=6) and its subclasses will convert numeric strings as well as integers to floats.

- [`DBForeignKey`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBForeignKey&version=6) will convert a blank string to 0.

- [`DBInt`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBInt&version=6) will convert integer like strings to integers.

- [`DBYear`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBYear&version=6) will convert integer like strings to integers. Also shorthand years are converted to full years (e.g. "24" becomes "2024").

In most cases though, the correct scalar type must now be used. For instance it is no longer possible to set an integer value on a `DBVarchar` field. You must use a string.

Some new DBField subclasses have been added which will provide validation for specific types of data:

- [`DBEmail`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBEmail&version=6) for email addresses.

- [`DBIp`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBIp&version=6) for IP addresses.

- [`DBUrl`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBUrl&version=6) for URLs.

To use these new field types, simply define them in a DataObject subclass:

php 'Email',
        // Values will be validated as an IP address

WARNING
If you have an existing project that uses Varchar fields for email addresses, IP addresses, or URLs, and you switch to using one of the new DBField types, be aware that some of the values in the database may fail validation the next time they are saved which could cause issues for CMS editors.

You may wish to create a [`BuildTask`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CDev%5CBuildTask&version=6) that calls [`DataObject::validate()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject::validate()&version=6) on all affected records to identify what data needs to be updated.

While we have tried to match the validation rules up to what would already have been stored in the database, there is a chance you'll find yourself with pre-existing data which doesn't meet the validation rules, and which therefore causes validation exceptions to be thrown the next time you try to save those records.

If that happens, you may be able to resolve it with one of the following solutions:

- If there is a form field for that database column, update the value in the form to a valid value before saving the record.

- Write a `BuildTask` that updates any invalid values in your database (see [`BuildTask` documentation](/en/6/developer_guides/cli/polycommand/#buildtask)).

- While it's generally not recommended, you have the option of disabling validation via the [`DataObject.validation_enabled`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject->validation_enabled&version=6) configuration property.

In addition, the following `DBField` subclasses have also had the following changes made to them:

- [`DBBoolean`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBBoolean&version=6) will no longer convert non-boolean like values to a `bool` when calling `setValue()`. For instance `"Amazing"` will no longer be converted to `true`, instead its value will remain as `"Amazing"` and it will fail validation. There are some boolean-like values, such as `"t"`, that will continue to be converted to their boolean equivalents for backwards compatibility.

- [`DBCurrency`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBCurrency&version=6) will no longer parse numeric values contained in a string when calling `setValue()` unless the string is entirely numeric. For instance `"this is 50.29 dollars"` will no longer be converted to `"$50.29"`, instead its value will remain as `"this is 50.29 dollars"` and it will fail validation.

- [`DBDecimal`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBDecimal&version=6) will no longer parse numeric values contained in a string when calling `setValue()` unless the string is entirely numeric. For example `"This is -123.45"` will no longer be converted to `"-123.45"`, instead its value will remain as `"This is -123.45"` and it will fail validation. Fully numeric strings like `"-123.45"` will still be cast and not throw validation exceptions.

- [`DBPercentage`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBPercentage&version=6) stores values internally as a float. It will no longer convert values above `1.0` such as `2.3` to `1.0` when calling `setValue()`. Instead, it will keep the value as `2.3`. If the value exceeds the value of [`DBPercentage::getMaxValue()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBPercentage::getMaxValue()&version=6), which has a default value of `1.0`, then it will fail validation.

See [`FormField` classes now use `FieldValidator` for validation](#formfield-validation) for other validation changes that will work along-side these in CMS interactions.

#### Validation exceptions shows additional info in some contexts {#validation-exception-info}

[`ValidationResult`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CValidation%5CValidationResult&version=6) objects created by [`DataObject::validate()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject::validate()&version=6) now include additional information about validation exceptions, including the field name that failed validation, and if applicable the model class and record ID.

The value of the field that failed validation is intentially not included in the output, as it could contain sensitive information e.g. an API token.

This additional information will be included in the validation message by [`ValidationException`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CValidation%5CValidationException&version=6) if:

- the validation exception happened in a CLI context, or

- the validation exception happened in an HTTP context and the current controller is an instance or subclass of one of the classes listed in the new [`ValidationException.show_additional_info_non_cli_controllers`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CValidation%5CValidationException->show_additional_info_non_cli_controllers&version=6) configuration.

This is done to help developers debug validation issues that happen outside of a UX context more easily, such as validation exceptions that occur when building the database.

By default only [`DevelopmentAdmin`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CDev%5CDevelopmentAdmin&version=6) and its subclasses are configured to show additional information in an HTTP context.

### Changes to password validation {#password-validation}

#### `PasswordValidator` changes {#passwordvalidator-changes}

The `SilverStripe\Security\PasswordValidator` class (which used to be the default password validator) has been renamed to [`RulesPasswordValidator`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CValidation%5CRulesPasswordValidator&version=6) and is now optional.

A new [`EntropyPasswordValidator`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CValidation%5CEntropyPasswordValidator&version=6) class has been created, and is now the default password validator. `EntropyPasswordValidator` is powered by the [`PasswordStrength` constraint](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints/PasswordStrength.html) in `symfony/validator`. This constraint determines if a password is strong enough based on its entropy, rather than on arbitrary rules about what characters it contains.

This change does not retroactively affect existing passwords, but will affect any new passwords (e.g. new members or changing the password of an existing member).

You can change the required strength of valid passwords by setting the [`EntropyPasswordValidator.password_strength`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CValidation%5CEntropyPasswordValidator->password_strength&version=6) configuration property to one of the valid [`minScore` values](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints/PasswordStrength.html#minscore):

yaml📋 Copy```yaml
SilverStripe\Security\Validation\EntropyPasswordValidator:
  password_strength: 4
```

`EntropyPasswordValidator` also has the same options for avoiding repeat uses of the same password that `RulesPasswordValidator` has.

If you want to revert to the validator that was used in CMS 5, you can do so with this YAML configuration:

yaml📋 Copy```yaml
---
After: '#corepasswords'
---
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\Security\Validation\PasswordValidator:
    class: 'SilverStripe\Security\Validation\RulesPasswordValidator'
```

See [passwords](/en/6/developer_guides/security/secure_coding/#passwords) for more information about password validation.

#### New `sha512` password hasher {#new-sha512-password-hasher}

The [`cwp/cwp-core`](https://packagist.org/packages/cwp/cwp-core) module provided a password hasher for `sha512` specifically for NZISM (New Zealand Information Security Manual) compliance (see [HMAC algorithms in the NZISM document](https://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Block-16074)).

`cwp/cwp-core` is no longer a commercially supported module, however the password hasher has been moved into `silverstripe/framework` as [`PasswordEncryptorPBKDF2`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CPasswordEncryptorPBKDF2&version=6).

This means users whose passwords were hashed using this algorithm will still be able to log into their account after you have upgraded to CMS 6.

`cwp/cwp-core` also changed the *default* hasher, but for CMS 6 the hashing algorithm is `blowfish`. If you wish to change the default hashing algorithm to `sha512`, you can do so with this YAML snippet:

yaml📋 Copy```yaml
SilverStripe\Security\Security:
  password_encryption_algorithm: 'pbkdf2_sha512'
```

#### `ConfirmedPasswordField` changes {#confirmedpasswordfield-changes}

If [`ConfirmedPasswordField->requireStrongPassword`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CConfirmedPasswordField->requireStrongPassword&version=6) is set to true, the old behaviour was to validate that at least one digit and one alphanumeric character was included. This meant that you could have a password like "a1" and it would be considered "strong".

This has been changed to use the [`PasswordStrength` constraint](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints/PasswordStrength.html) in `symfony/validator` instead. Now a password is considered "strong" based on its level of entropy.

You can change the level of entropy required by passing one of the valid [`minScore` values](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints/PasswordStrength.html#minscore) into [`ConfirmedPasswordField::setMinPasswordStrength()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CConfirmedPasswordField::setMinPasswordStrength()&version=6).

### `RedirectorPage` validation {#redirectorpage-validation}

[`RedirectorPage`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CModel%5CRedirectorPage&version=6) now uses the [`Url` constraint](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints/Url.html) from `symfony/validator` to validate the `ExternalURL` field. It will no longer add `http://` to the start of URLs for you if you're missing a protocol - instead, a validation error message will be displayed.

### Changes to `sake`, `BuildTask`, and CLI interaction in general {#cli-changes}

Until now, running `sake` on the command line has executed a simulated HTTP request to your Silverstripe CMS project, using the routing and controllers that your web application uses to handle HTTP requests. This resulted in both a non-standard CLI experience and added confusion about when an [`HTTPRequest`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CControl%5CHTTPRequest&version=6) actually represented an HTTP request.

We've rebuilt Sake using [`symfony/console`](https://symfony.com/doc/current/console.html) - the same package that powers Composer.

Here are some common commands you can run with Sake (depending on your setup, you may need to prepend these with `vendor/bin/` e.g. `vendor/bin/sake`):

bash --help # e.g. &#x60;sake db:build --help&#x60;
" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard">📋 Copy```bash
# list available commands
sake # or `sake list`

# list available tasks
sake tasks

# build the database
sake db:build

# flush the cache
sake flush # or use the `--flush` flag with any other command

# get help info about a command (including tasks)
sake &#x3C;command> --help # e.g. `sake db:build --help`
```

NOTE
To reduce upgrade pains we've retained backwards compatability with the legacy syntax for `dev/*` routed actions (e.g. `sake dev/build flush=1` will still work). This allows you to continue using existing scripts and cron jobs.
This legacy syntax is deprecated, and will stop working in a future major release.

If for some reason you specifically need to access an HTTP route in your project using Sake, you can use the new `sake navigate` command, e.g. `sake navigate about-us/teams`.

See the [sake documentation](/en/6/developer_guides/cli/sake/) for more information about using and configuring `sake`, including how to register your own custom commands.

There is also a new [`PolyCommand`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CPolyExecution%5CPolyCommand&version=6) class which provides a standardised API for code that needs to be accessible from both an HTTP request and CLI. This is used for `BuildTask` and other code accessed via `/dev/*` as mentioned below.

See the [`PolyCommand` documentation](/en/6/developer_guides/cli/polycommand/) for more details about the `PolyCommand` API.

#### Changes to `BuildTask` {#cli-buildtask}

Change to API
The [`BuildTask`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CDev%5CBuildTask&version=6) class is now a subclass of `PolyCommand`.

As a result of this, any `BuildTask` implementations in your project or module will need to be updated. The upgrade will likely look like this in most cases:

Note that you should no longer output "done" or some equivalent message at the end of the task. Any time a task finishes executing, the output will include a message about whether the task completed successfully or failed (based on the return value) and how long it took.

See [`PolyCommand`](/en/6/developer_guides/cli/polycommand/#buildtask) for more details about the `BuildTask` API.

Change to names
Some tasks were relying on the FQCN instead of having an explicit name. This means the name used for both the URL and the CLI command were excessively long.

The way these are displayed in the new `sake tasks` list doesn't suit long names, so we have given explicit names to these tasks in order to make them shorter. If you have scripts or cron jobs that reference these you will need to update them to use the new name.

For example, you used to navigate to `/dev/tasks/&#x3C;OLD_NAME>` or use `sake dev/tasks/&#x3C;OLD_NAME>`. Now you will need to navigate to `/dev/tasks/&#x3C;NEW_NAME>` or use `sake tasks:&#x3C;NEW_NAME>`.

| Class | Old name | New name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`ContentReviewEmails`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CContentReview%5CTasks%5CContentReviewEmails&version=6) | `SilverStripe-ContentReview-Tasks-ContentReviewEmails` | `content-review-emails` |

| [`MigrateContentToElement`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=DNADesign%5CElemental%5CTasks%5CMigrateContentToElement&version=6) | `DNADesign-Elemental-Tasks-MigrateContentToElement` | `elemental-migrate-content` |
| [`StaticCacheFullBuildTask`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CStaticPublishQueue%5CTask%5CStaticCacheFullBuildTask&version=6) | `SilverStripe-StaticPublishQueue-Task-StaticCacheFullBuildTask` | `static-cache-full-build` |

#### `sake -start` and `sake -stop`have been removed {#cli-daemon}

Sake used to have functionality to make daemon processes for your application. This functionality was managed with `sake -start my-process` and `sake -stop my-process`.

We've removed this functionality. Please use an appropriate daemon tool such as `systemctl` to manage these instead.

### Changes to `/dev/*`actions {#dev-actions}

With the changes to `sake` come changes to the way `dev/*` actions are handled, both in the browser and in CLI. Most of these are now subclasses of the new [`DevCommand`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CDev%5CCommand%5CDevCommand&version=6) class which is itself a subclass of [`PolyCommand`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CPolyExecution%5CPolyCommand&version=6).

One small change as a result of this is the `dont_populate` parameter for `dev/build` and for the new `db:build` CLI command has been deprecated. Use `no-populate` instead. For example use `https://example.com/dev/build/?no-populate=1` and `sake db:build --no-populate`.

#### Registering `dev/*`commands {#dev-registering}

If you have custom actions registered under `DevelopmentAdmin.registered_controllers` you'll need to update the YAML configuration for these. If you want them to be accessible via CLI, you'll also have to update the PHP code.

With the below example, there are two custom actions displayed in the list at `/dev`:

- `/dev/my-http-only-action`: intended for use in the browser only, but you'd have to add custom logic in `init()` to disallow its use in CLI until now

- `/dev/my-http-and-cli-action`: intended for use both in CLI and in the browser.

For actions that should only be accessible in the browser, you only need to change how these are registered. Move them from `DevelopmentAdmin.registered_controllers` to the new [`DevelopmentAdmin.controllers`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CDev%5CDevelopmentAdmin->controllers&version=6) configuration property.

Controllers added to `DevelopmentAdmin.controllers` can only be accessed via HTTP requests, so you can remove any logic around CLI usage.

For actions that should be accessible in the browser *and* via CLI, you will need to change these from being a `Controller` to subclassing `DevCommand`. These get registered to the new [`DevelopmentAdmin.commands`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CDev%5CDevelopmentAdmin->commands&version=6) configuration property:

You would now access the `/dev/my-http-only-action` action via an HTTP request only. The `/dev/my-http-and-cli-action` action can be access via an HTTP request, or by using `sake app:my-http-and-cli-action` on the command line.

The `some-var` option can be used in a query string when running the action via an HTTP request (e.g. `/dev/my-http-and-cli-action?some-var=1`), or as a flag (e.g. `sake app:my-http-and-cli-action --some-var`) in CLI.

See [`PolyCommand`](/en/6/developer_guides/cli/polycommand/#dev-commands) for more details about the `DevCommand` API.

### Changes to default cache adapters {#caching}

The [`DefaultCacheFactory`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CCache%5CDefaultCacheFactory&version=6) used to use APCu cache by default for your webserver - but we found this cache isn't actually shared with CLI. This means flushing cache from the CLI didn't actually flush the cache your webserver was using.

What's more, the `PHPFilesAdapter` used as a fallback wasn't enabled for CLI, which resulted in having a different filesystem cache for CLI than is used for the webserver.

We've made the following changes to resolve this problem:

- There is no default in-memory cache used by `DefaultCacheFactory` (APCu cache used to be used by default).

- The `PHPFilesAdapter` will only be used if it's available for both the webserver *and* CLI. Otherwise, `FilesystemAdapter` will be used for both.

- Cache factories have been implemented for Redis, Memcached, and APCu, with a new [`InMemoryCacheFactory`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CCache%5CInMemoryCacheFactory&version=6) interface available for your own implementations.

We strongly encourage you to configure an appropriate in-memory cache for your use-case. See [adding an in-memory cache adapter](/en/6/developer_guides/performance/object_caching/#adapters) for details.

### Changes to scaffolded form fields {#scaffolded-fields}

Some of the scaffolded form fields used for relations have changed.

Previously, `File`, `Image`, and `Folder` were all scaffolded using `UploadField` for `has_one` relations, and `GridField` for `has_many` and `many_many` relations.

All other models used `SearchableDropdownField` for `has_one` relations and `GridField` for `has_many` and `many_many` relations.

Now the following fields are scaffolded:

| Class | `has_one` | `has_many` | `many_many` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`SiteTree`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CModel%5CSiteTree&version=6) | [`TreeDropdownField`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CTreeDropdownField&version=6) | [`TreeMultiselectField`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CTreeMultiselectField&version=6) | [`TreeMultiselectField`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CTreeMultiselectField&version=6) |

### `SiteTree`uses form field scaffolding {#sitetree-scaffolding}

[`SiteTree::getCMSFields()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CModel%5CSiteTree::getCMSFields()&version=6) used to create its form fields from scratch, without calling `parent::getCMSFields()`. This meant that all subclasses of `SiteTree` (i.e. all of your `Page` classes) had to explicitly define all form fields.

`SiteTree::getCMSFields()` now uses the same form field scaffolding that most other `DataObject` subclasses use.

Note that this means when you initially upgrade to Silverstripe CMS 6 you may have form fields being added to your CMS edit forms that you don't want to include, or tabs from relations that you don't want.

You can use the [`scaffold_cms_fields_settings`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject->scaffold_cms_fields_settings&version=6) configuration property to change which fields are being scaffolded. See the [scaffolding](/en/6/developer_guides/model/scaffolding/#scaffolding-options) section for more details about using these options.

For example, if you have a database column for which you don't want content authors to see or edit the value, you can use the `ignoreFields` option to stop the form field for that column from being scaffolded:

php 'Varchar',
    ];

    private static array $scaffold_cms_fields_settings = [
        'ignoreFields' => [
            'SecretToken',
        ],
    ];
}
" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard">📋 Copy```php
namespace App\PageTypes;

use Page;

class MyCustomPage extends Page
{
    // ...
    private static array $db = [
        'SecretToken' => 'Varchar',
    ];

    private static array $scaffold_cms_fields_settings = [
        'ignoreFields' => [
            'SecretToken',
        ],
    ];
}
```

WARNING
You might currently have form fields that are only added if some condition is true, for example if the user has certain permissions. If you change nothing, those fields will likely display for all users editing the record.
You can make the fields only appear conditionally by doing one of the following:

- Reverse the condition - if you are currently adding a field if some condition is true, change your logic so you instead remove the scaffolded form field if that condition is false.

- Use the `scaffold_cms_fields_settings` configuration to ensure those form fields are not scaffolded. You can then leave your logic as is for those fields.

As part of your CMS 6 upgrade, you should check all of the page types in your project and in any modules you maintain to ensure the correct form fields are available in the appropriate tabs. You should also check [`Extension`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CExtension&version=6) subclasses that you know get applied to pages to ensure fields aren't being scaffolded from those that you want to keep hidden. As with all configuration, you can set `scaffold_cms_fields_settings` configuration in your `Extension` subclass and it will be merged into the configuration for the classes it gets applied to.

#### What if I don't have time to upgrade all of my page types? {#what-if-i-dont-have-time-to-upgrade-all-of-my-page-types}

If you have a lot of complex page types and extensions, upgrading all of them to account for the new scaffolding might be a large task. If you want to avoid upgrading your `getCMSFields()` and `updateCMSFields()` implementations initially, you can use the `restrictRelations` and `restrictFields` scaffolding options in the `scaffold_cms_fields_settings` configuration property for your pages. You can then declare that only the fields introduced in parent classes should be scaffolded.

The below YAML configuration can be used as a base for this workaround. It will work for all page types available in commercially supported modules. If you use page types provided in third-party modules, you may need to add configuration for those as well.

Click to see the YAML configuration snippet

yaml📋 Copy```yaml
SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree:
  scaffold_cms_fields_settings:
    restrictRelations:
      # This will stop all has_many and many_many relations from being
      # scaffolded except for new relations which are added to this list
      - 'ThisRelationDoesntExist'
    restrictFields:
      # These fields are scaffolded from SiteTree, and are the bare minimum
      # fields that we need to be scaffolded for all page types
      - 'Title'
      - 'MenuTitle'
      - 'URLSegment'
      - 'Content'

SilverStripe\CMS\Model\VirtualPage:

      - 'AutoWidth'
      - 'FixedHeight'
      - 'FixedWidth'
      - 'BottomContent'
      - 'AlternateContent'

SilverStripe\UserForms\Model\UserDefinedForm:
  scaffold_cms_fields_settings:
    restrictRelations:
      - 'EmailRecipients'
```

WARNING
Note that this is explicitly intended as a temporary workaround, so that you can focus on other areas of the upgrade first, and come back to your page form fields later.

As more community modules are upgraded to account for form field scaffolding in their page types and extension classes, you may
need to add more fields to this list. To avoid having to continuously update these lists it's recommended that you take the time
to update your `getCMSFields()` and `updateCMSFields()` implementations as soon as you have time to do so.

### New `SingleRecordAdmin` class and changes to `SiteConfig` {#singlerecordadmin}

A new [`SingleRecordAdmin`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAdmin%5CSingleRecordAdmin&version=6) class has been created which makes it easier to create an admin section for editing a single record.

This is the new super class for [`SiteConfigLeftAndMain`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSiteConfig%5CSiteConfigLeftAndMain&version=6) and [`CMSProfileController`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAdmin%5CCMSProfileController&version=6).

As part of this change, we have removed the `updateCurrentSiteConfig` extension hook on [`SiteConfig`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSiteConfig%5CSiteConfig&version=6) and updated the `canDelete()` permissions on `SiteConfig` to explicitly return `false` by default, even for administrators.

The `getCMSActions()` method of `SiteConfig` also no longer returns the save action, as that is handled by the controller which instantiates the edit form. Other actions added through `getCMSActions()` (e.g. if you added them through an extension) will still be included.

### MySQL now defaults to utf8mb4 {#mysql-utf8mb4}

MySQL will now use `utf8mb4` by default rather than plain `utf8`. This provides better support for emojis and other special characters.

Depending on when you created your Silverstripe CMS project, you may already be using `utf8mb4` as the default encoding. The `silverstripe/recipe-core` recipe has included a configuration file setting your database settings to `utf8mb4` for a few years.

When upgrading your Silverstripe CMS project, review the `app/_config/mysite.yml` file and remove the following lines if they exist:

yaml📋 Copy```yaml
# UTF8MB4 has limited support in older MySQL versions.
# Remove this configuration if you experience issues.
---
Name: myproject-database
---
SilverStripe\ORM\Connect\MySQLDatabase:
  connection_charset: utf8mb4
  connection_collation: utf8mb4_unicode_ci
  charset: utf8mb4
  collation: utf8mb4_unicode_ci
```

### Run `CanonicalURLMiddleware`in all environments by default {#url-middleware}

In Silverstripe CMS 5 [`CanonicalURLMiddleware`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CControl%5CMiddleware%5CCanonicalURLMiddleware&version=6) only runs in production by default. This lead to issues with some functionality behaving differently in production environments compared to development. Silverstripe 6.0 changes this default to run the rules in `dev`, `test`, and `live` by default.

To opt out of this change include the following in your `_config.php`

phpsetEnabledEnvs([
    CoreKernel::LIVE,
]);
" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard">📋 Copy```php
use SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\CanonicalURLMiddleware;
use SilverStripe\Core\CoreKernel;

CanonicalURLMiddleware::singleton()->setEnabledEnvs([
    CoreKernel::LIVE,
]);
```

### Session and authentication cookie changes {#session-cookie-changes}

Session and authentication cookies have been updated to be more secure. Other cookies have not been changed.

The default value of [`Session.cookie_secure`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CControl%5CSession->cookie_secure&version=6) has been changed from `false` to `true`, and the default value of [`CookieAuthenticationHandler->TokenCookieSecure`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CMemberAuthenticator%5CCookieAuthenticationHandler->TokenCookieSecure&version=6) has been changed from `false` to `true`. This value corresponds with the cookie `Secure` attribute.

The session cookie name is now always `PHPSESSID`, regardless of whether the connection is secure (HTTPS) or insecure (HTTP). The previously used `SECSESSID` for secure connections is no longer utilized, and the name of this cookie is no longer configurable.

The default value of [`Session.cookie_samesite`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CControl%5CSession->cookie_samesite&version=6) has been changed from `Lax` to `Strict`, and [`CookieAuthenticationHandler->tokenCookieSameSite`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CMemberAuthenticator%5CCookieAuthenticationHandler->tokenCookieSameSite&version=6) has been added with a default value of `Strict`. This value corresponds to the cookie `SameSite` attribute. This has been done as a security measure to help prevent cross-site attacks.

While it's generally not recommended, if you have a requirement to change these values you can do so via YAML:

yaml📋 Copy```yaml
SilverStripe\Control\Session:
  cookie_secure: false
  cookie_samesite: 'Lax'

SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\Security\MemberAuthenticator\CookieAuthenticationHandler:
    properties:
      TokenCookieSecure: false
      TokenCookieSameSite: 'Lax'
```

### `DBDecimal`default value {#dbdecimal-default-value}

Previously if an invalid default value was provided for a [`DBDecimal`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBDecimal&version=6) database column, it would silently set the default value to `0`. This will now throw an exception instead, so that you're aware your configured value is invalid and can correct it.

### Update JS MIME type, remove `type` in `&#x3C;script>`tags {#js-mime-type-update}

We've updated the MIME type for JavaScript from `"application/javascript"` to `"text/javascript"`. Additionally, the `type` attribute has been omitted from any `&#x3C;script>` tags generated by Silverstripe CMS itself (e.g. in the Requirements API). The most up-to-date RFC says to use `"text/javascript"` in HTML5. Since modern browsers will default to that type when one isn't explicitly declared, it is generally encouraged to omit it instead of redundantly setting it.

- **Before:** `&#x3C;script type="application/javascript" src="...">&#x3C;/script>`

- **After:** `&#x3C;script src="...">&#x3C;/script>`

This change is generally backward-compatible and should not affect existing functionality. However, if your project explicitly relies on the `type` attribute for `&#x3C;script>` tags, you may need to adjust accordingly.

### `getSchemaDataDefaults()`now includes attributes {#formfield-schema-data}

The [`FormField::getSchemaDataDefaults()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CFormField::getSchemaDataDefaults()&version=6) method (and by extension the [`getSchemaData()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CFormField::getSchemaData()&version=6) method) now calls [`getAttributes()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CFormField::getAttributes()&version=6). This was done so that attributes such as `placeholder` can be used in the react components that render form fields.

In the past it was common to call `getSchemaData()` inside the `getAttributes()` method, so that a form field rendered in an entwine admin context had the data necessary to bootstrap a react component for that field. Doing that now would result in an infinite recursion loop.

If you were calling `getSchemaData()` in your `getAttributes()` method in a `FormField` subclass, include `$SchemaAttributesHtml` in your template instead. For example:

diffgetSchemaData());
-    return $attributes;
-}
" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard">📋 Copy```diff
-public function getAttributes()
-{
-    $attributes = parent::getAttributes();
-    $attributes['data-schema'] = json_encode($this->getSchemaData());
-    return $attributes;
-}
```

diff
+
" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard">📋 Copy```diff
-&#x3C;div $AttributesHTML>&#x3C;/div>
+&#x3C;div $AttributesHTML $SchemaAttributesHtml>&#x3C;/div>
```

### Remember me token rotation {#remember-me-token-rotation}

[`RememberLoginHash`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CRememberLoginHash&version=6) no longer rotates its token during session renewal, and related config to control this has been removed. This has no functional impact on the Remember Me feature, and resolves some edgecases that could trigger an unexpected logout.

The related `onAfterRenewToken` extension hook has been renamed to `onAfterRenewSession`, and is triggered at the same logical step in the session renewal process.

### Read-only replica database support {#db-read-only-replicas}

Read-only replicas are additional databases that are used to offload read queries from the primary database, which can improve performance by reducing the load on the primary database.

Read-only replicas are configured by adding environment variables that match the primary environment variable and suffixing `_REPLICA_&#x3C;replica-number>` to the variable name, where `&#x3C;replica_number>` is the replica number padding by a zero if it's less than 10. Replicas must be numbered sequentially starting from `01`.

text📋 Copy```text
SS_DATABASE_SERVER="primary-database-server-name"

SS_DATABASE_SERVER_REPLICA_01="read-only-server1"
SS_DATABASE_SERVER_REPLICA_02="read-only-server2"
#...
SS_DATABASE_SERVER_REPLICA_12="read-only-server12"
```

Replicas cannot define different configuration values for `SS_DATABASE_CLASS`, `SS_DATABASE_NAME`, or `SS_DATABASE_CHOOSE_NAME`. Those are restricted to prevent strange issues that could arise from having inconsistent database configurations across replicas.

The `SS_DATABASE_SERVER`, `SS_DATABASE_USERNAME`, and `SS_DATABASE_PASSWORD` must be defined for each replica. If a port other than the default should be used, `SS_DATABASE_PORT` must also be defined for each replica.

If one or more read-only replicas have been configured, then for each request one of the read-only replicas will be randomly selected from the pool of available replicas to handle queries for the rest of the request cycle, unless criteria has been met to use the primary database instead, for example a write operation.

When replicas are configured, calling the method [`DB::get_conn()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDB::get_conn()&version=6) will now give a replica by default if one is able to be used. To get the primary database connection, call `DB::get_conn(DB::CONN_PRIMARY)` instead.

Note that the `DB::CONN_PRIMARY` constant is used to specify the primary database used, which is the database that will be used for write operations. Prior to CMS 6 when there was no DB replica support, the primary database was referred to as "default". If you have code that uses the string "default" to refer to the primary database, you should update it to use the `DB::CONN_PRIMARY` constant instead.

Note that some [`DataQuery`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataQuery&version=6) methods such as [`DataQuery::execute()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataQuery::execute()&version=6) now work slightly differently as they will use the replica database if the queried `DataObject` has the [`DataObject.must_use_primary_db`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject->must_use_primary_db&version=6) configuration set to `true`. However calling the equivalent [`SQLSelect`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CQueries%5CSQLSelect&version=6) method via a `DataQuery` e.g. `$dataQuery->query()->execute()` will not respect the `DataObject.must_use_primary_db` configuration.

See [read-only database replicas](/en/6/developer_guides/performance/read_only_database_replicas/) for more details.

### Improvements to template functionality {#improvements-to-template-functionality}

As part of the [improved separation between the view and model layers](#view-layer-separation), the following improvements have been made to the way templates work:

- Native indexed PHP arrays can now be passed into templates and iterated over with `&#x3C;% loop $MyArray %>`.

Under the hood they are wrapped in [`ArrayList`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CList%5CArrayList&version=6), so you can get the count using `$MyArray.Count` and use `&#x3C;% if $MyArray %>` as a shortcut for `&#x3C;% if $MyArray.Count %>`.

- Other functionality from `ArrayList` such as filtering and sorting cannot be used on these arrays since they don't have keys to filter or sort against.

Arguments are now passed into getter methods when invoked in templates. For example, if a model has a `getMyField(...$args)` method and `$MyField(1,2,3)` is used in a template, the args `1, 2, 3` will be passed in to the `getMyField()` method.
Values from template variables are passed into functions when used as arguments

- For example, `$doSomething($Title)` will pass the value of the `Title` property into the `doSomething()` method. Previously `"$Title"` would be passed as a string. See [template syntax](/en/6/developer_guides/templates/syntax/#variables) documentation for more details.

### Performance improvements for site tree rendering {#site-tree-performance}

Performance improvements have been made to the rendering of the site tree used to show all of the pages in the CMS using a combination of more efficient database queries and in-memory caching. The primary focus of this work was to reduce the total number of database requests being made, as this has been found to be a significant source of perceived slowness when Silverstripe CMS is in a distributed hosting setup where the database is on a different physical server from the webserver.

As part of this change a new method [`Hierarchy::getChildrenForTree()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CHierarchy%5CHierarchy::getChildrenForTree()&version=6) has been created which replaces [`Hierarchy::AllChildrenIncludingDeleted()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CHierarchy%5CHierarchy::AllChildrenIncludingDeleted()&version=6) as the default method used to get children to render in the site tree. `Hierarchy::AllChildrenIncludingDeleted()` is now deprecated.

If you want to use `Hierarchy::AllChildrenIncludingDeleted()` to get items to display in the site tree (for example to take advantage of the`augmentAllChildrenIncludingDeleted` extension hook), this can be done with the following config:

yaml📋 Copy```yaml
SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree:
  tree_children_method: 'AllChildrenIncludingDeleted'
```

However it is recommended to use the new method instead and update your code to use the new `updateGetChildrenForTree` extension hook in `Hierarchy::getChildrenForTree()` instead.

### Filter within a range with `searchable_fields` {#searchable-withinrange}

Using the `searchable_fields` configuration, you can now declare that a field should be filtered using a range. This works out of the box with the numeric, date, datetime, and time fields that come in the Silverstripe framework.

TIP
You can also provide ranges for other field types, but it requires some additional configuration.

php 'Currency',
    ];

    private static array $searchable_fields = [
        'Price' => WithinRangeFilter::class,
    ];
}
" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard">📋 Copy```php
namespace App\Model;

use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;
use SilverStripe\ORM\Filters\WithinRangeFilter;

class MyDataObject extends DataObject
{
    // ...
    private static array $db = [
        'Price' => 'Currency',
    ];

    private static array $searchable_fields = [
        'Price' => WithinRangeFilter::class,
    ];
}
```

This configuration will duplicate the form field, providing one form field for the "from" value, and another for the "to" value. Users can then filter within a range using the filters in the CMS.

If a user fills in only the "from" or "to" field, the other will be populated with the minimum or maximum value defined by the relevant `DBField` class in [`getMinValue()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBField::getMinValue()&version=6) or [`getMaxValue()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBField::getMaxValue()&version=6)

See the [searchable fields documentation](/en/6/developer_guides/model/scaffolding/#searchable-fields-withinrangefilter) for more details.

### Status flags in the CMS {#status-flags-in-the-cms}

In CMS 5 the CMS showed status flags for the [`SiteTree`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CModel%5CSiteTree&version=6) class inside the `/admin/pages` section, and occasionally for other models in grid fields - but this was inconsistent and was done in a variety of different ways depending on what was adding the flags and where they were displayed.

We've standardised this in the new [`ModelData::getStatusFlags()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelData::getStatusFlags()&version=6) method to define the flags, and [`ModelData::getStatusFlagMarkup()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelData::getStatusFlagMarkup()&version=6) to build the HTML markup for them. This means that status flags can be displayed for *any* model in the CMS.

This is already used to show what locale the data is in for models localised using [`tractorcow/silverstripe-fluent`](https://github.com/tractorcow-farm/silverstripe-fluent/), and what versioned stage it's in for models using the [`Versioned`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CVersioned%5CVersioned&version=6) extension.

Status flags are displayed in breadcrumbs at the top of edit forms in the CMS, in the site tree for `CMSMain`, for each row in a grid field, and in [`dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-elemental/) and [`silverstripe/linkfield`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-linkfield).

See [status flags](/en/6/developer_guides/customising_the_admin_interface/status_flags/) for more information.

### New `Versioned` methods {#new-versioned-methods}

The following new methods have been added to [`Versioned`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CVersioned%5CVersioned&version=6) to make it easier to get records in the various versioning states:

- [`updateListToAlsoIncludeStage()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CVersioned%5CVersioned::updateListToAlsoIncludeStage()&version=6) - Gives the same results as [`get_by_stage()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CVersioned%5CVersioned::get_by_stage()&version=6), but you can pass it a list to modify instead of it giving you a new list.

- [`updateListToAlsoIncludeDeleted()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CVersioned%5CVersioned::updateListToAlsoIncludeDeleted()&version=6) - Gives the same results as [`get_including_deleted()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CVersioned%5CVersioned::get_including_deleted()&version=6), but you can pass it a list to modify instead of it giving you a new list.

- [`getRemovedFromDraft()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CVersioned%5CVersioned::getRemovedFromDraft()&version=6) - Returns a list of records (both published and archived) which have been removed from draft.

- [`updateListToOnlyIncludeRemovedFromDraft()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CVersioned%5CVersioned::updateListToOnlyIncludeRemovedFromDraft()&version=6) - Gives the same results as `getRemovedFromDraft()`, but you can pass it a list to modify instead of it giving you a new list.

- [`getArchivedOnly()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CVersioned%5CVersioned::getArchivedOnly()&version=6) - Returns a list of only records which have been archived.

- [`updateListToOnlyIncludeArchived()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CVersioned%5CVersioned::updateListToOnlyIncludeArchived()&version=6) - Gives the same results as `getArchivedOnly()`, but you can pass it a list to modify instead of it giving you a new list.

### Other new features {#other-new-features}

- Modules no longer need to have a root level `_config.php` or `_config/` directory to be recognised as a Silverstripe CMS module. They will now be recognised as a module if they have a `composer.json` file with a `type` of "silverstripe-vendormodule" or "silverstripe-theme".

- A new [`DataObject::getCMSEditLink()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject::getCMSEditLink()&version=6) method has been added, which returns `null` by default. This provides more consistency for that method which has previously been inconsistently applied to various subclasses of `DataObject`. See [managing records](/en/6/developer_guides/model/managing_records/#getting-an-edit-link) for more details about providing appropriate values for this method in your own subclasses.

- The [`UrlField`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CUrlField&version=6) class has some new API for setting which protocols are allowed for valid URLs.

- The [`EmailField`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CEmailField&version=6) class now uses `symfony/validator` to handle its validation logic, where previously this was validated with a custom regex.

- [`ArrayData`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CArrayData&version=6) can now be serialised using [`json_encode()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php).

- Cloning a [`Form`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CForm&version=6) will now recursively clone its validator, fields list, and actions list. This means they're completely independent, and updating the clone won't affect the original form.

- You can now set the `samesite` attribute for all cookies individually. See [secure sessions and cookies](/en/6/developer_guides/security/secure_coding/#secure-sessions-and-cookies) for details.

- The old convoluted way to add a history tab to an edit form by updating GraphQL queries and injecting react components no longer works. Instead, just add a [`HistoryViewerField`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CVersionedAdmin%5CForms%5CHistoryViewerField&version=6) to your form.

## Bug fixes {#bug-fixes}

This release includes a number of bug fixes to improve a broad range of areas. Check the change logs for full details of these fixes split by module. Thank you to the community members that helped contribute these fixes as part of the release!

- [`PaginatedList::count()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CPaginatedList::count()&version=6) used to give the total number of items in the underlying unpaginated list. This wasn't consistent with the number of items in the current page, which is what you get when iterating over the list. The `count()` method now gives you the number of items in the *current page* only. If you want to total number of items in the unpaginated list, use [`PaginatedList::getTotalItems()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CPaginatedList::getTotalItems()&version=6) instead.

- [`Path::join()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CPath::join()&version=6), [`File::find()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CFile::find()&version=6), [`File::filterFilename()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CFile::filterFilename()&version=6), and [`Folder::find_or_make()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssets%5CFolder::find_or_make()&version=6) used to filter out any part of the path that was only `0` (e.g. would return `'a/b'` instead of `'a/0/b'`). This has been fixed. It is possible some paths that were generated with the buggy logic will now become invalid as a result.

- [`GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CGridField%5CGridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter&version=6) will no longer search against fields whos configuration opts out of being included in a general search field. See [exclude fields from the general search](/en/6/developer_guides/model/scaffolding/#general-search-field) for details about that configuration.

## API changes {#api-changes}

### Many renamed classes {#renamed-classes}

Lots of classes have been renamed or moved into a new namespace. We have listed these here for convenience. You will need to update any references from the old Fully Qualified Class Names to use the new names and namespaces instead.

Note that there will be cases where a class has been completely replaced with another class - those scenarios are not listed here but are included in the [full list of removed and changed API](#api-removed-and-changed).

WARNING
Many of these classes will have had additional changes made to them in addition to being renamed. Details about those changes will be in the relevant sections of this changelog.
Do not assume that updating reference to the class name is all you need to do to upgrade your project.

There are a lot of classes which were in the `SilverStripe\ORM` namespace and a few in the `SilverStripe\View` namespace that simply don't belong there.

| Old FQCN | New FQCN |

| `SilverStripe\View\ArrayData` | [`SilverStripe\Model\ArrayData`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CArrayData&version=6) |
| `SilverStripe\View\ViewableData` | [`SilverStripe\Model\ModelData`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelData&version=6) |

| `SilverStripe\View\ViewableData_Debugger` | [`SilverStripe\Model\ModelDataDebugger`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelDataDebugger&version=6) |

NOTE
The change from `ViewableData` to `ModelData` specifically was made to improve the separation between the model layer and the view layer. It didn't make much sense for a class called `ViewableData` to be the superclass for all of our model types. The new name better reflects the purpose of this class as the base class for models.

These classes and interfaces were moved into a new module, so their namespaces have been updated (see [abstraction of template rendering](#view-layer-abstraction) for details):

| Old FQCN | New FQCN |
| --- | --- |
| `SilverStripe\View\SSViewer_BasicIteratorSupport` | [`SilverStripe\TemplateEngine\BasicIteratorSupport`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CTemplateEngine%5CBasicIteratorSupport&version=6) |

| `SilverStripe\View\TemplateIteratorProvider` | [`SilverStripe\TemplateEngine\TemplateIteratorProvider`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CTemplateEngine%5CTemplateIteratorProvider&version=6) |
| `SilverStripe\View\TemplateParser` | [`SilverStripe\TemplateEngine\TemplateParser`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CTemplateEngine%5CTemplateParser&version=6) |

The following classes were changed when code was moved to the `silverstripe/reports` module from some of the modules that lost commercial support:

| Old FQCN | New FQCN |
| --- | --- |
| `SilverStripe\ExternalLinks\BrokenExternalLinksReport` | [`SilverStripe\Reports\ExternalLinks\Reports\BrokenExternalLinksReport`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CReports%5CExternalLinks%5CReports%5CBrokenExternalLinksReport&version=6) |

| `SilverStripe\ExternalLinks\Model\BrokenExternalPageTrack` | [`SilverStripe\Reports\ExternalLinks\Model\BrokenExternalPageTrack`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CReports%5CExternalLinks%5CModel%5CBrokenExternalPageTrack&version=6) |
| `SilverStripe\ExternalLinks\Model\BrokenExternalPageTrackStatus` | [`SilverStripe\Reports\ExternalLinks\Model\BrokenExternalPageTrackStatus`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CReports%5CExternalLinks%5CModel%5CBrokenExternalPageTrackStatus&version=6) |

| `SilverStripe\SecurityReport\Forms\GridFieldExportReportButton` | [`SilverStripe\Reports\SecurityReport\Forms\GridFieldExportReportButton`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CReports%5CSecurityReport%5CForms%5CGridFieldExportReportButton&version=6) |
| `SilverStripe\SecurityReport\Forms\GridFieldPrintReportButton` | [`SilverStripe\Reports\SecurityReport\Forms\GridFieldPrintReportButton`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CReports%5CSecurityReport%5CForms%5CGridFieldPrintReportButton&version=6) |
| `SilverStripe\SecurityReport\MemberReportExtension` | [`SilverStripe\Reports\SecurityReport\MemberReportExtension`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CReports%5CSecurityReport%5CMemberReportExtension&version=6) |

[`Validator`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CValidation%5CValidator&version=6), its subclasses, and some related classes have been renamed:

| Old FQCN | New FQCN |
| --- | --- |
| `SilverStripe\Forms\Validator` | [`SilverStripe\Forms\Validation\Validator`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CValidation%5CValidator&version=6) |
| `SilverStripe\Forms\RequiredFields` | [`SilverStripe\Forms\Validation\RequiredFieldsValidator`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CValidation%5CRequiredFieldsValidator&version=6) |
| `SilverStripe\Forms\CompositeValidator` | [`SilverStripe\Forms\Validation\CompositeValidator`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CValidation%5CCompositeValidator&version=6) |
| `SilverStripe\UserForms\Form\UserFormsRequiredFields` | [`SilverStripe\UserForms\Form\UserFormsRequiredFieldsValidator`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CUserForms%5CForm%5CUserFormsRequiredFieldsValidator&version=6) |

The class names for the `TopPage` feature in [`dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-elemental) did not follow the correct naming convention for Silverstripe CMS. The class names have been changed as follows:

| Old FQCN | New FQCN |
| --- | --- |
| `DNADesign\Elemental\TopPage\DataExtension` | [`DNADesign\Elemental\Extensions\TopPageElementExtension`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=DNADesign%5CElemental%5CExtensions%5CTopPageElementExtension&version=6) |
| `DNADesign\Elemental\TopPage\FluentExtension` | [`DNADesign\Elemental\Extensions\TopPageFluentElementExtension`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=DNADesign%5CElemental%5CExtensions%5CTopPageFluentElementExtension&version=6) |
| `DNADesign\Elemental\TopPage\SiteTreeExtension` | [`DNADesign\Elemental\Extensions\TopPageSiteTreeExtension`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=DNADesign%5CElemental%5CExtensions%5CTopPageSiteTreeExtension&version=6) |

The following miscellaneous classes and interfaces were also renamed:

| Old FQCN | New FQCN |
| --- | --- |
| `SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\LeftAndMainPageIconsExtension` | [`SilverStripe\CMS\Controllers\LeftAndMainRecordIconsExtension`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CControllers%5CLeftAndMainRecordIconsExtension&version=6) |
| `SilverStripe\CMS\Model\CurrentPageIdentifier` | [`SilverStripe\CMS\Model\CurrentRecordIdentifier`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CModel%5CCurrentRecordIdentifier&version=6) |
| `SilverStripe\Dev\Constraint\ViewableDataContains` | [`SilverStripe\Dev\Constraint\ModelDataContains`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CDev%5CConstraint%5CModelDataContains&version=6) |
| `SilverStripe\Dev\Validation\DatabaseAdminExtension` | [`SilverStripe\Dev\Validation\DbBuildExtension`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=ilverStripe%5CDev%5CValidation%5CDbBuildExtension&version=6) |
| `SilverStripe\Logging\HTTPOutputHandler` | [`SilverStripe\Logging\ErrorOutputHandler`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CLogging%5CErrorOutputHandler&version=6) |

### Changes to some extension hook names {#hooks-renamed}

In order to better align the codebase in Silverstripe CMS with best practices, the following extension hook methods have changed name:

| Class that defined the hook | Old name | New name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`Member`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CMember&version=6) | `afterMemberLoggedIn` | `onAfterMemberLoggedIn` |
| [`Member`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CMember&version=6) | `afterMemberLoggedOut` | `onAfterMemberLoggedOut` |
| [`Member`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CMember&version=6) | `authenticationFailed` | `onAuthenticationFailed` |
| [`Member`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CMember&version=6) | `authenticationFailedUnknownUser` | `onAuthenticationFailedUnknownUser` |
| [`Member`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CMember&version=6) | `authenticationSucceeded` | `onAuthenticationSucceeded` |
| [`Member`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CMember&version=6) | `beforeMemberLoggedIn` | `onBeforeMemberLoggedIn` |
| [`Member`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CMember&version=6) | `beforeMemberLoggedOut` | `onBeforeMemberLoggedOut` |
| [`LeftAndMain`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAdmin%5CLeftAndMain&version=6) | `init` | `onInit` |
| [`DataObject`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject&version=6) | `flushCache` | `onFlushCache` |
| [`LostPasswordHandler`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CMemberAuthenticator%5CLostPasswordHandler&version=6) | `forgotPassword` | `onForgotPassword` |
| [`ErrorPage`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CErrorPage%5CErrorPage&version=6) | `getDefaultRecords` | `updateDefaultRecords` |
| [`SiteTree`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CModel%5CSiteTree&version=6) | `MetaComponents` | `updateMetaComponents` |
| [`SiteTree`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CModel%5CSiteTree&version=6) | `MetaTags` | `updateMetaTags` |
| [`DataObject`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject&version=6) | `populateDefaults` | `onAfterPopulateDefaults` |
| [`Member`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CMember&version=6) | `registerFailedLogin` | `onRegisterFailedLogin` |
| [`DataObject`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject&version=6) | `requireDefaultRecords` | `onRequireDefaultRecords` |
| [`DataObject`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject&version=6) | `validate` | `updateValidate` |

The following were additionally changed to match the renamed methods which invoke them:

| Class that defined the hook | Old name | New name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`CMSMain`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CControllers%5CCMSMain&version=6) | `updateLinkPageAdd` | `updateLinkRecordAdd` |
| [`CMSMain`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CControllers%5CCMSMain&version=6) | `updateSiteTreeAsUL` | `updateTreeAsUL` |
| [`CMSMain`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CControllers%5CCMSMain&version=6) | `updateSiteTreeHints` | `updateTreeHints` |
| [`CMSMain`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CControllers%5CCMSMain&version=6) | `updateCurrentPageID` | `updateCurrentRecordID` |

The `updateCurrentRecordID` extension hook method is now invoked from [`LeftAndMain`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAdmin%5CLeftAndMain&version=6), which is a superclass of `CMSMain`.

On [`RememberLoginHash`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CRememberLoginHash&version=6) the `onAfterRenewToken` extension hook has been renamed to `onAfterRenewSession` - see [remember me token rotation](#remember-me-token-rotation) for details.

If you have implemented any of those methods in an [`Extension`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CExtension&version=6) subclass, you will need to rename them for them to continue working.

### Most extension hook methods are now protected {#hooks-protected}

Core implementations of most extension hooks such as `updateCMSFields()` now have `protected` visibility. Formerly they had `public` visibility which meant they could be called directly which was not how they were intended to be used. Extension hook implementations are still able to be declared `public` in project code, though it is recommended that all extension hook methods are declared `protected` in project code to follow best practice.

### GraphQL removed from the CMS {#graphql-removed}

NOTE
If you need to use GraphQL in your project for public-facing frontend schemas, you can still install and use the [`silverstripe/graphql`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql) module.

GraphQL has been removed from the admin section of the CMS and is no longer installed when creating a new project using [`silverstripe/installer`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-installer), or an existing project that uses [`silverstripe/recipe-cms`](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-cms). All existing functionality in the CMS that previously relied on GraphQL has been migrated to use regular Silverstripe CMS controllers instead.

Any customisations made to the `admin` GraphQL schema will no longer work. There are extension hooks available on the new controller endpoints for read operations, for example [`AssetAdminOpen::apiRead()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAssetAdmin%5CController%5CAssetAdminOpen::apiRead()&version=6) that allow you to customise the JSON data returned.

PHP code such as resolvers that were in [`silverstripe/asset-admin`](http://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin), [`silverstripe/cms`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-cms) and [`silverstripe/versioned`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-versioned) have been move to the [`silverstripe/graphql`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql) module and have had their namespace updated. The GraphQL yml config for the versioned module has also been copied over as that was previously enabled by default on all schemas. The GraphQL YAML configuration for the `silverstripe/asset-admin` and `silverstripe/cms` modules has not been moved as as that was only enabled on the admin schema.

If your project does not have any custom GraphQL, after upgrading you may still have the old `.graphql-generated/` and `public/_graphql/` folders in your project. You can safely remove these folders.

### Changes to the templating/view layer {#view-layer}

Note that the `SilverStripe\View\ViewableData` class has been renamed to [`SilverStripe\Model\ModelData`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelData&version=6). We will refer to it as `ModelData` in the rest of these change logs.

See [many renamed classes](#renamed-classes) for more information about this change.

In general, if you want to just keep using the ss template syntax you're familiar with, you shouldn't need to change anything (except as specified in other sections or if you were using API that has moved or been removed).

#### Improved separation between the view and model layers {#view-layer-separation}

Historically the `ModelData` class did double-duty as being the base class for most models as well as being the presumed class wrapping data for the template layer. Part of this included methods like `XML_val()` being called on any object in the template layer, despite being methods very specifically implemented on `ModelData`.

Any data that wasn't wrapped in `ModelData` was hit-and-miss as to whether it would work in the template layer, and whether the *way* you can use it is consistent. It also meant the `ModelData` class had some complexity it didn't necessarily need to represent a model.

To improve the separation between the view and model layers (and in some cases as quality-of-life improvements), we've made the following changes:

- Added a new [`ViewLayerData`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CView%5CViewLayerData&version=6) class which sits between the template layer and the model layer. All data that gets used in the template layer gets wrapped in a `ViewLayerData` instance first. This class provides a consistent API and value lookup logic so that all data gets treated the same way once it's in the template layer.

- Move casting logic into a new [`CastingService`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CView%5CCastingService&version=6) class. This class is responsible for casting data to the correct model (e.g. by default strings get cast to [`DBText`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBText&version=6) and booleans get cast to [`DBBoolean`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBBoolean&version=6)). If the source of the data is known and is an instance of `ModelData`, the casting service calls [`ModelData::castingHelper()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelData:castingHelper()&version=6) to ensure the [`ModelData.casting`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelData->casting&version=6) configuration and (in the case of `DataObject`) the db schema are taken into account.

- Implemented a default [`ModelData::forTemplate()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelData::forTemplate()&version=6) method which will attempt to render the model using templates named after it and its superclasses. See [`forTemplate` and `$Me`](/en/6/developer_guides/templates/syntax/#fortemplate) for information about this method's usage.

[`ModelDataCustomised::forTemplate()`](/en/6/changelogs/silverstripe/model/modeldatacustomised::fortemplate()/) explicitly uses the `forTemplate()` method of the class being customised, not from the class providing the customisation.

The `ModelData::XML_val()` method has been removed as it is no longer needed to get values for usage in templates.
The [`ModelData::obj()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelData::obj()&version=6) method now also passes arguments into getter methods. Note however that this method is no longer used to get values in the template layer.
The [`ModelData::objCacheSet()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelData::objCacheSet()&version=6) and [`ModelData::objCacheGet()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelData::objCacheGet()&version=6) methods now deal with raw values prior to being cast. This is so that `ViewLayerData` can use the cache reliably.
Nothing in core or supported modules (except for the template engine itself) relies on absolute file paths for templates - instead, template names and relative paths (without the `.ss` extension) are used.

- [`Email::getHTMLTemplate()`](/en/6/changelogs/silverstripe/control/email/email::gethtmltemplate()/) now returns an array of template candidates, unless a specific template was set using `setHTMLTemplate()`.

- `ThemeResourceLoader::findTemplate()` has been removed without a replacement.

- `SSViewer::chooseTemplate()` has been removed without a replacement.

`TemplateEngine` classes will throw a [`MissingTemplateException`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CView%5CException%5CMissingTemplateException&version=6) if there is no file mapping to any of the template candidates passed to them.
The [`Email::setHTMLTemplate()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CControl%5CEmail%5CEmail::setHTMLTemplate()&version=6) and [`Email::setPlainTemplate()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CControl%5CEmail%5CEmail::setPlainTemplate()&version=6) methods used to strip the `.ss` extension off strings passed into them. They no longer do this. You should double check any calls to those methods and remove the `.ss` extension from any strings you're passing in, unless those strings represent full absolute file paths.
The old `&#x3C;% _t("My_KEY", "Default text") %>` and `&#x3C;% sprintf(_t("My_KEY", "Default text with %s"), "replacement") %>` i18n syntaxes have been removed. Use the syntax described in the [i18n documentation](/en/6/developer_guides/i18n/#usage-in-template-files) instead.

WARNING
If you were overriding `ModelData::XML_val()` or `ModelData::obj()` to influence values used in the template layer, you will need to try an alternative way to alter those values.
Best practice is to implement getter methods in most cases - but as a last resort you could implement a subclass of `ViewLayerData` and replace it using the injector.

If you have set the [`ModelData.default_cast`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelData->default_cast&version=6) configuration property for some model, consider unsetting this so that the relevant `DBField` instance is chosen based on the type of the value, and use `ModelData.casting` if some specific fields need to be cast to non-default classes.

#### Abstraction of template rendering {#view-layer-abstraction}

The [`SSViewer`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CView%5CSSViewer&version=6) class previously had two duties:

1. 
2. 

This made that class difficult to maintain. It also made it difficult to use other template rendering solutions with Silverstripe CMS since the barrier between the two layers was tightly coupled to the ss template rendering solution.

The template rendering functionality has now been abstracted. `SSViewer` still acts as the barrier between the model and template layers, but it now delegates rendering templates to an injectable [`TemplateEngine`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CView%5CTemplateEngine&version=6).

`TemplateEngine` is an interface with all of the methods required for `SSViewer` and the rest of Silverstripe CMS to interact reliably with your template rendering solution of choice. For now, all of the templates provided in core and supported modules will use the familiar ss template syntax and the default template engine will be [`SSTemplateEngine`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CTemplateEngine%5CSSTemplateEngine&version=6). This template engine lives in the new  [`silverstripe/template-engine` module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-template-engine/).

Along with making the default template engine easier to maintain, these changes also open the door for you to experiment with alternative template rendering solutions if you want to. There are various ways to declare which rendering engine to use, which are explained in detail in the [swap template engines](/en/6/developer_guides/templates/swap_template_engines/) documentation.

Some API which used to be on `SSViewer` is now on `SSTemplateEngine`, and some has been outright removed. The common ones are listed here, but see [full list of removed and changed API](#api-removed-and-changed) below for the full list.

- The `SSViewer.global_key` configuration property is now [`SSTemplateEngine.global_key`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CTemplateEngine%5CSSTemplateEngine->global_key&version=6).

- `SSViewer::chooseTemplate()` has been removed without a replacement.

- `SSViewer::hasTemplate()` is now [`TemplateEngine::hasTemplate()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CView%5CTemplateEngine::hasTemplate()&version=6).

- `SSViewer::fromString()` and the `SSViewer_FromString` class have been replaced with [`TemplateEngine::renderString()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CView%5CTemplateEngine::renderString()&version=6).

Along with those API changes, several classes and interfaces were moved into the new module. See [many renamed classes](#renamed-classes) for details.

### Strong typing for `ModelData` and `DBField` {#model-strong-typing}

Many of the properties and methods in [`ModelData`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelData&version=6), [`DBField`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CFieldType%5CDBField&version=6), and their immediate subclasses have been given strong typehints. Previously, these only had typehints in the PHPDoc which meant that any arbitrary values could be assigned or returned.

Most of the strong types are either identical to the old PHPDoc types, or match what was already actually being assigned to, passed into, and returned from those APIs.

In some cases, where a string was expected but sometimes `null` was being used, we have explicitly strongly typed the API to `string`. This matches [similar changes PHP made in PHP 8.1](https://php.watch/versions/8.1/internal-func-non-nullable-null-deprecation) and will help avoid passing `null` values in to functions that expect a string.

The one change we specifically want to call out is for [`ModelData::obj()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CModelData::obj()&version=6). This method will now explicitly return `null` if there is no field, property, method, etc to represent the field you're trying to get an object for. This is a change from the old behaviour, where an empty `DBField` instance would be returned even though there's no way for any non-null value to be available for that field.

See the [full list of removed and changed API](#api-removed-and-changed) to see all of the API with updated typing.

### Changes to `LeftAndMain`and its subclasses {#leftandmain-refactor}

[`LeftAndMain`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAdmin%5CLeftAndMain&version=6) has historically been the superclass for all controllers routed in `/admin/*` (i.e. all controllers used in the CMS). It's also the superclass for admin-routed controllers which manage modal forms. That class includes a lot of boilerplate functionality for setting up a menu, edit form, etc which a lot of controllers don't need.

A new [`AdminController`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAdmin%5CAdminController&version=6) has been created which provides the `/admin/*` routing functionality and permission checks that `LeftAndMain` used to be responsible for. If you have a controller which needs to be routed through `/admin/*` with the relevant CMS permission checks, but which does *not* need a menu item on the left or an edit form, you should update that class to be a subclass of `AdminController` instead.

The new [`FormSchemaController`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAdmin%5CFormSchemaController&version=6) class (which is a subclass of `AdminController`) now owns the logic required for injecting and managing forms inside modals.

As a result of these changes, the following classes have had their class hierarchy updated:

| Class | Old superclass | New superclass |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`LeftAndMain`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAdmin%5CLeftAndMain&version=6) | [`Controller`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CControl%5CController&version=6) | `FormSchemaController` |
| [`SudoModeController`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAdmin%5CSudoModeController&version=6) | `LeftAndMain` | `AdminController` |
| [`ElementalAreaController`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=DNADesign%5CElemental%5CControllers%5CElementalAreaController&version=6) | [`CMSMain`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CControllers%5CCMSMain&version=6) | `FormSchemaController` |
| [`HistoryViewerController`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CVersionedAdmin%5CControllers%5CHistoryViewerController&version=6) | `LeftAndMain` | `FormSchemaController` |
| [`UserDefinedFormAdmin`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CUserForms%5CControl%5CUserDefinedFormAdmin&version=6) | `LeftAndMain` | `FormSchemaController` |
| [`AdminRegistrationController`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CMFA%5CController%5CAdminRegistrationController&version=6) | `LeftAndMain` | `AdminController` |
| [`LinkFieldController`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CLinkField%5CControllers%5CLinkFieldController&version=6) | `LeftAndMain` | `FormSchemaController` |
| [`SubsiteXHRController`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSubsites%5CController%5CSubsiteXHRController&version=6) | `LeftAndMain` | `AdminController` |
| [`CMSExternalLinksController`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CExternalLinks%5CControllers%5CCMSExternalLinksController&version=6) | `Controller` | `AdminController` |

The `tree_class` configuration property on `LeftAndMain` and its subclasses has be renamed to [`model_class`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAdmin%5CLeftAndMain->model_class&version=6), and a new [`getModelClass()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAdmin%5CLeftAndMain::getModelClass()&version=6) method has been implemented to return it. This is used in methods like [`getRecord()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAdmin%5CLeftAndMain::getRecord()&version=6) to get a record of the correct class.

The `getModelClass()` method is the same method used in `ModelAdmin` to get the class for the currently accessed tab. This parity means you can predictably call `getModelClass()` on any initialised subclass of `LeftAndMain` and get an appropriate base class to work with.

Some localisation keys have changed as a result of the refactor, so if you are using the localisation API to update localised text in a `LeftAndMain` controller, you may need to update the key for your customisation.

#### Changes to`CMSMain` {#cmsmain-refactor}

[`CMSMain`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CControllers%5CCMSMain&version=6) is a subclass of `LeftAndMain` which provides the main way of managing page content in the CMS. It had a lot of hardcoded references to [`SiteTree`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CModel%5CSiteTree&version=6) and `Page`, despite most of its functionality being compatible with any class that uses the [`Hierarchy`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CHierarchy%5CHierarchy&version=6) extension.

The hardcoded references have been removed, along with other assumptions that the model class for `CMSMain` was always a `SiteTree`. This opens up the way for a future enhancement to introduce a new generalised version of `CMSMain` that works with any model using the `Hierarchy` extension, which could be implemented in projects similar to how `ModelAdmin` is used.

As a result of this, a lot of references to "page" have been removed from both API and UI elements. A full list of API changes can be found [at the bottom of the changelog](#api-removed-and-changed).

#### Effects of these refactors in other classes {#effects-of-these-refactors-in-other-classes}

Some classes outside of the `LeftAndMain` class hierarchy have also been affected by the refactoring:

- The `SiteTree.need_permission` configuration property has been removed. This wasn't used in permission checks anyway, so these permissions would have had to be separately checked in `canCreate()` to have the intended effect. If you were using this configuration property, implement a change to `canCreate()` in your `Page` class instead.

- The `SiteTree.description` configuration property has been renamed to [`class_description`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject->class_description&version=6).
This configuration has been added to `DataObject` along with the corresponding [`classDescription()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject::classDescription()&version=6) and [`i18n_classDescription()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject::i18n_classDescription()&version=6) methods.

- The [`BaseElement::getTypeNice()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=DNADesign%5CElemental%5CModels%5CBaseElement::::getTypeNice()&version=6) method now calls `i18n_classDescription()` to get the text it will display.

- The [`Hierarchy`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CHierarchy%5CHierarchy&version=6) extension now has a bunch of configuration and methods which used to be exclusive to `SiteTree`.

#### Changes to some CSS selectors {#leftandmain-selectors}

The `jstree-pageicon` CSS class is now `jstree-recordicon`, and the `page-icon` CSS class is now `record-icon`.

Some of the CSS selectors that had been added to the edit forms in [`SiteConfigLeftAndMain`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSiteConfig%5CSiteConfigLeftAndMain&version=6) and [`CMSProfileController`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CAdmin%5CCMSProfileController&version=6) are no longer available - if you were using CSS selectors in those admin sections, you may need to change the way you're handling that.

### `FormField` classes now use `FieldValidator`for validation {#formfield-validation}

Many of [`FormField`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CFormField&version=6) subclasses in the `SilverStripe\Forms` namespace now use `FieldValidator` classes for validation, which are also used for `DBField` validation. This has meant that much of the old `validate()` logic on `FormField` subclasses has been removed as it was duplicated in the `FieldValidator` classes. Some custom logic in `validate()` methods not found in `FieldValidator` classes methods has been retained.

IMPORTANT
As part of this change, [`FormField::validate()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CFormField::validate()&version=6) now returns a [`ValidationResult`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CValidation%5CValidationResult&version=6) object where it used to return a boolean. The `$validator` parameter has also been removed.

If you have implemented a custom `validate()` method in a `FormField` subclass, you will need to update it to return a `ValidationResult` object instead and remove the `$validator` parameter.

The `extendValidationResult()` method and the `updateValidationResult` extension hook on `FormField` have both been removed and replaced with an `updateValidate` hook instead, which has a single `ValidationResult $result` parameter. This matches the `updateValidate` extension hook on `DataObject`.

See [validation added to `DBFields`](#dbfield-validation) for other validation changes that will work along-side this validation during CMS interactions.

### `CMSMain`search filter changes {#cmsmain-search-filter}

The search filter in the "Pages" admin section (aka [`CMSMain`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CControllers%5CCMSMain&version=6)) is visually similar to the search filters in other sections of the CMS, but has until now had a completely different code path and therefore slightly different functionality.

In CMS 6 that functionality now follows the same code paths used by [`GridFieldFilterHeader`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CGridFieldGridFieldFilterHeader&version=6) which powers the search filters in most other sections of the CMS.

This means `CMSMain` search filters now rely on `SearchContext` to perform the actual filtering, and get their configuration from the [`searchable_fields`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject->searchable_fields&version=6) configuration property. Since `CMSMain` uses [`SiteTree`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CModel%5CSiteTree&version=6) as its model class by default, you'll need to update the `searchable_fields` configuration for `SiteTree` via YAML configuration if you want to update the fields users can filter against.

Shared functionality for building the search filter form has been moved from `CMSMain` and `GridFieldFilterHeader` into a new [`SearchContextForm`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CSearch%5CSearchContextForm&version=6) class. Some of the HTML markup for the search filters has also been updated so it can be shared across all CMS sections.

One consequence of this is that [`CMSSiteTreeFilter`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CControllers%5CCMSSiteTreeFilter&version=6) and its subclasses are no longer primarily responsible for filtering in the "Pages" admin section. They are still used for filtering by the status (e.g. draft vs modified) of pages. If you had implemented a custom `CMSSiteTreeFilter` subclass, you will need to either modify it (if it is intended to provide functionality for filtering by a status) or look into refactoring it into a replacement or extension for the [`SiteTreeSearchContext`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCMS%5CSearch%5CSiteTreeSearchContext&version=6) class.

The `DNADesign\Elemental\Controllers\ElementSiteTreeFilterSearch` class has also changed - it is now [`ElementalSiteTreeSearchContext`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=DNADesign%5CElemental%5CORM%5CSearch%5CElementalSiteTreeSearchContext&version=6). All of the configuration that applied to the old class applies to the new one, so you may need to update that name in your configuration. Refer to [searching blocks](/en/6/optional_features/elemental/searching-blocks/#cms-page-search) for more information about this class and the performance impacts it brings with it.

### `FormField::Value()`split into three methods {#formfield-value}

`SilverStripe\Forms\FormField::Value()` has been split into three methods:

- [`FormField::getValue()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CFormField::getValue()&version=6) which usually returns an unmodified version of the value

- [`FormField::getFormattedValue()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CFormField::getFormattedValue()&version=6) which is intended to be modified with things like localisation formatting and will be displayed to users

- [`FormField::dataValue()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CFormField::dataValue()&version=6) which represents the value as passed into a record when [`saveInto()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CFormField::saveInto()&version=6) is called. Usually this is the same as `getValue()`.

If you have overridden the `Value()` method in a subclass, you will need to update the method name to one of these, depending on the purpose of the custom functionality. If you use `$Value` in a template to get the value of a form field, you should update it to `$FormattedValue`.

### `getCMSValidator`method no longer supported {#getcmsvalidator}

In a `DataObject` subclass, you used to be able to implement a `getCMSValidator()` method and return a [`Validator`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CValidation%5CValidator&version=6) for validating edit form submissions in the CMS.

This is no longer supported. Instead, you should override the [`DataObject::getCMSCompositeValidator()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject::getCMSCompositeValidator()&version=6) method as described in [validation in the CMS](/en/6/developer_guides/forms/validation/#validation-in-the-cms).

### `Controller::has_curr()`removed {#controller-has-curr}

The `SilverStripe\Control\Controller::has_curr()` method has been removed. If you were using this method in your project then you should replace it with a call to [`Controller::curr()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CControl%5CController::curr()&version=6) and checking if it returned `null`, meaning if there is no current controller. This is equivalent to checking if `has_curr()` had returned `false`. `Controller::curr()` no longer creates an exception if there is no current controller.

### Strict typing for `Factory`implementations {#factory-strict-typing}

The [`Factory::create()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CInjector%5CFactory::create()&version=6) method now has strict typehinting. The first argument must be a string, and either `null` or an object must be returned.

One consequence of this is that you can no longer directly pass an instantiated anonymous class object into [`Injector::load()`](/en/6/changelogs/silverstripe/core/injector/injector::load()/). Instead, you need to get the class name using [`get_class()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-class.php) and pass that in as the class.

phpproperty = $value;
    }
});

Injector::inst()->load([
    ClassToReplace::class => [
        'class' => $replacementClass,
    ],
]);
" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard">📋 Copy```php
use App\ClassToReplace;
use SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector;

// Use `get_class()` to get the class name for your anonymous class
$replacementClass = get_class(new class () {
    private string $property;

    public function __construct(string $value = null)
    {
        $this->property = $value;
    }
});

Injector::inst()->load([
    ClassToReplace::class => [
        'class' => $replacementClass,
    ],
]);
```

### List interface changes {#list-interface-changes}

The [`SS_List`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CList%5CSS_List&version=6) interface now includes the methods from the `Filterable`, `Limitable`, and `Sortable` interfaces, which have now been removed. This means that any class that implements `SS_List` must now also implement the methods from those interfaces.

Many of the methods on `SS_List` and the classes that implement it are now strongly typed. This means that you will need to ensure that any custom classes that implement `SS_List` have the correct types for the methods that they implement.

As part of these changes [`ArrayList::find()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CList%5CArrayList::find()&version=6) will no longer accept an int argument for the `$key` param, it will now only accept a string argument.

### General changes {#api-general}

- [`DataObject::validate()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject::validate()&version=6) now has an explicit [`ValidationResult`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CValidation%5CValidationResult&version=6) return type.

- [`DataObject::write()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject::write()&version=6) has a new boolean `$skipValidation` parameter. This can be useful for scenarios where you want to automatically create a new record with no data initially without restricting how developers can set up their validation rules.

- [`FieldList`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CFieldList&version=6) is now strongly typed. Methods that previously allowed any iterable variables to be passed, namely [`FieldList::addFieldsToTab()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CFieldList::addFieldsToTab()&version=6) and [`FieldList::removeFieldsFromTab()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CForms%5CFieldList::removeFieldsFromTab()&version=6), now require an array to be passed instead.

- `DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement::getDescription()` and the corresponding `DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement.description` configuration property have been removed. If you were using either of these in your custom elemental blocks, either set the new [`class_description`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject->class_description&version=6) configuration property or override one of the [`i18n_classDescription()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CORM%5CDataObject::i18n_classDescription()&version=6) or [`getTypeNice()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=DNADesign%5CElemental%5CModels%5CBaseElement::getTypeNice()&version=6) methods instead.

- `SilverStripe\ORM\DataExtension`, `SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTreeExtension`, and `SilverStripe\Admin\LeftAndMainExtension` have been removed. If you subclass any of these classes, you must now subclass [`Extension`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CCore%5CExtension&version=6) directly instead.

- The `SilverStripe\Model\List\ArrayList.default_case_sensitive` configuration property has been removed. This means the default case sensitivity of [`ArrayList`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CModel%5CList%5CArrayList&version=6) is now the same as any other list which uses search filters. If you were using that configuration property, or you were relying on `ArrayList` being case sensitive by default, you should double check that your list filters are working the way you expect. See [search filters](/en/6/developer_guides/model/searchfilters/#modifiers) for details about case sensitivity in search filters.

- The execution flow for [`ChangePasswordHandler::changepassword()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CMemberAuthenticator%5CChangePasswordHandler::changepassword()&version=6) has changed slightly. The session isn't updated until after the redirect now. If you overrode that method expecting the session to be updated prior to the redirect, you probably want to override the new protected [`createChangePasswordResponse()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CSecurity%5CMemberAuthenticator%5CChangePasswordHandler::createChangePasswordResponse()&version=6) method instead.

- The `CMSEditLink()` method on many `DataObject` subclasses has been renamed to `getCMSEditLink()`.

- Support for the `$CurrentPageURL` template variable, which was previously used to populate email templates with the current page URL, has been removed. This variable was unreliable and is no longer supported.
